# Preface

[OceanWatch](https://oceanwatch.pifsc.noaa.gov/) organizes a 3-day satellite course at [PIFSC](https://www.pifsc.noaa.gov/) every year, following the model developed in 2006 by Cara Wilson and Dave Foley from [CoastWatch West Coast](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/courses/satellite_course.html).

The course is a mix of lectures, tutorials and hands-on computer work on individual projects.  
  
 All course materials were developed and adapted over the years by:

* Cara Wilson, Dave Foley, Dale Robinson, Roy Mendelssohn - CoastWatch West Coast, SouthWest Fisheries Science Center
* Shelly Tomlinson, Ron Vogel - CoastWatch East Coast
* Melanie Abecassis, Jeff Polovina - OceanWatch Central Pacific
