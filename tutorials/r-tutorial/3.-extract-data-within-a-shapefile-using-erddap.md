# 3. Extract data within a shapefile using ERDDAP

This tutorial uses the Xtractomatic package to download data from within the boundaries of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument \(PMNM\).  
  
This script uses the rerddap version of Xtractomatic: rerddapXtracto.  
More information is available here: [https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/xtracto/](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/xtracto/)  
and here: [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rerddapXtracto/](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rerddapXtracto/)  
  
NOTE!! if you already have rerddap installed on your computer, you will need to uninstall it \(remove.packages\('rerddap'\)\) and reinstall it from Github to get the most recent version -&gt; see command line below.  
  
This tutorial will teach how to display SST values for a particular time period or average SST over the whole time-series available within the PMNM polygon boundary.  
  
PMNM boundaries were obtained at [http://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/library/imast\_gis.html](http://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/library/imast_gis.html). 

## Extract the monument boundaries from the downloaded shapefile.

Save the file [https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/library/imast/pmnm\_py.zip](https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/library/imast/pmnm_py.zip) on your computer and extract it.  
Navigate to the `PMNM_py_files` folder.

If you don't have the `sf` package installed on your computer, you will need to install it.  
`install.packages('sf')`

`library(sf)  
  
test=st_read('pmnm_/PMNM_py_files/PMNM_py.shp')   
PNMN=st_coordinates(test)  
write.csv(PNMN,'pnmn.csv')`

Open the `pnmn.csv` file in Excel and delete rows 493-497 and 2703-2705. This will prevent an extra line from being plotted where the monument boundary crosses the dateline.

## Install required packages from devtools

**Reminder**: if you already have rerddap installed on your computer, you will need to uninstall it:  
`remove.packages('rerddap')`

`devtools::install_github("ropensci/rerddap")   
devtools::install_github("ropensci/plotdap") devtools::install_github("rmendels/rerddapXtracto")`

## Load packages

`library(maps)   
library(mapdata)   
library(maptools)   
library(rerddap)   
library(rerddapXtracto)`

poly360=read.csv\('data/poly360.csv',header=FALSE\) \# polygon for PMNM names\(poly360\) &lt;- c\("Longitude","Latitude"\)
